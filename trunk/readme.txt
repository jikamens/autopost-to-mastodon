A Wordpress Plugin that automatically posts your new articles to Mastodon. The best: It is set and forget! 
 
== Description ==
 
With GNUsocial Autopost your post always get automatically posted to your Mastodon account.

They are posted in the form:

Find the plugin settings: Settings > Mastodon Autpost Settings

Just set your credentials and your post preference and lean back. The rest is done in the background and you don't have to care about it.
